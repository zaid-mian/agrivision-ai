# film-demo — zoom & compositing reference

Deep-dive for `scripts/{zoomplan,zoompan-expr,speedup,guardrails,inspect,render,compose,verify}.mjs`.
Read `SKILL.md` first; come back here when tuning the camera feel or debugging the ffmpeg graph.

## Why zones, not pixels

Commercial tools (Screen Studio, Cap, Recordly) analyze cursor position and (sometimes) frame
differencing to decide where and when to zoom. We don't need to — the beat script *declares* what
must be visible: `focus(locator | box)` / `wide()`. Playwright returns exact `boundingBox()`es in
the same coordinate space as the recording (see § resolution), so "make this region visible" is
pure arithmetic, not vision. `zoomplan.mjs` turns the ordered list of `focus`/`wide` events into
**shots**: contiguous time ranges, each with a crop center `(cx, cy)` and a zoom factor.

## Shot construction (`zoomplan.mjs`)

1. **Only `focus` and `wide` events create shots.** Clicks, typing, scrolls, appears, loading
   brackets never move the camera — they feed the cursor trace, activity model and guardrails only.
   This is the design decision that kills "zoom flicker on every click".
2. `cropForZone(box)` computes the crop:
   `zoom = clamp(min(sourceW / (box.w·(1+2·padding)), sourceH / (box.h·(1+2·padding))), minZoom, maxZoom)`
   with `padding: 0.22`, then clamps the center to keep the crop inside the frame. Because zoom is
   derived from the box size, **the zone always fits in the crop by construction** — this function is
   shared with `actions.mjs`, which uses the same crop for record-time containment warnings, and with
   guardrails' `zone-clipped` check (which should therefore never fire unless someone breaks this).
   A zone bigger than the frame at `minZoom` simply yields zoom=1 (wide) — declaring "this must be
   visible" on a huge element is valid and just means no zoom.
3. Camera events within `minShotSec` (0.8s) merge — the later one wins.
4. **Shot timing anchors on `tDepart`.** `focus()` stamps `tDepart`/`tArrive` around its own cursor
   nudge; the pan starts when the cursor starts moving. `transSec = clamp(tArrive - tDepart, 0.4, 1.2)`
   rides along per shot so camera and cursor arrive together.
5. **Travel-distance safety cap** (`travelMargin: 0.3`): consecutive shot centers far apart get their
   zooms capped so the crop stays wide enough for the cursor to remain visible during the pan. With
   explicit zones + cursor nudging this rarely fires; it's a last-resort floor.
6. Center clamping can pull `cx` away from a zone's literal center near viewport edges (docked
   panel) — expected; containment still holds because the crop is at least as big as zone+padding.

## Easing → ffmpeg expression (`zoompan-expr.mjs`)

Each shot's target value (for `zoom`, `cx`, `cy` independently) eases in from the *previous* shot's
value over that shot's own `transSec` (falls back to the global `transitionSec` default, 0.72s, when
the shot has none) using an ease-out cubic curve:

```
p     = clamp((in_time - shot.tStart) / transSec, 0, 1)
ease  = 1 - (1 - p)^3
value = prevValue + (curValue - prevValue) * ease
```

At `p=0` this is `prevValue`, at `p=1` (and beyond, since `p` is clamped) it's `curValue` — so one
formula covers both the transition *and* the hold, no separate branch needed. This is compiled into
one big `if(between(in_time, tStart, tEnd), <formula>, <rest>)` chain per axis, three chains total
(`z`, `x`, `y`), fed to ffmpeg's `zoompan` filter:

```
fps=30,zoompan=z='<zExpr>':x='max(min(<cxExpr>-(iw/zoom/2),iw-iw/zoom),0)':y='...':d=1:s=WxH:fps=30
```

Key facts about `zoompan` that make this work (confirmed against ffmpeg 8.x, see
`ffmpeg -h filter=zoompan` / ffmpeg.org docs):
- `in_time` is the input frame's timestamp in seconds — matches `timeline.json`'s `t` directly, no
  frame-counting math needed.
- `zoom` inside the `x`/`y` expressions refers to the *current frame's* just-evaluated `z` result —
  this is the documented idiom (`x='iw/2-(iw/zoom/2)'` in ffmpeg's own examples), so `x`/`y` don't need
  their own copy of the zoom formula.
- A leading `fps=30` filter is required before `zoompan` with `d=1` — without normalizing the input to
  a constant frame rate first, zoompan's per-input-frame duration bookkeeping doesn't line up with the
  recording's actual (variable) frame rate.
- Long nested `if(between(...))` chains are the standard, documented way to do multi-keyframe zoompan
  (see ffmpeg.org's own "zoom in only for the first second" example) — not a hack.

Ease-out cubic (fast departure, slow settle) reads closer to a Screen Studio pan feel than a
raised-cosine or linear curve. If pans still feel harsh on review, the shot almost certainly has an
unusually short `tArrive - tDepart` (fast click) — check the timeline before raising the global
`transitionSec` default, since most shots now use their own `transSec`.

## Post-record speed-up (`speedup.mjs`, single encode)

Applied automatically by `compose.mjs` before zoom (skip with `--no-speedup`). Plans ALL
compressions first, applies them in **one** ffmpeg `split/trim/setpts/concat` pass (one re-encode
total instead of one per segment), then remaps every timestamp — events **and** the cursor trace —
through the same `makeTimeMap(segments)` so `timeline.json` stays frame-accurate.

Planned segments, in priority order (later passes skip anything overlapping an earlier one):
1. **Lead** — everything before the first event anchor minus 0.3s pad is dropped entirely.
2. **Pre-tool wait** — `loading-start` → first `appear`/`click` compressed to ≤2.5s.
3. **Tool spinner** — each `appear` → matching `done` (`label-done`) compressed to ≤4s.
4. **Generic inactivity** — the activity model (`activityIntervals`) unions every
   `[tDepart, t]` window (cursor travel + typing + clicks) plus scroll windows; any gap in the
   complement > `idleGapMin` (3.5s) is compressed to `idleGapMax` (1.8s), **regardless of the
   surrounding event types**. This is the pass that kills residual dead air.

Label convention for tools/API calls (both `async`, take `page` first — they nudge the cursor to the box):
```javascript
await appear(page, timeline, 'load-report', box)
await done(page, timeline, 'load-report', box)  // logs as load-report-done
```

## Guardrails (`guardrails.mjs`) — the deterministic reviewer

Runs automatically at the end of every `compose`; rerun anytime with
`node scripts/guardrails.mjs <renderDir>`. It replays the exact camera math the final video
used — `cameraAt(shots, t)` in `zoompan-expr.mjs` is the JS twin of the compiled ffmpeg expression
(same easing, same clamping; keep them in sync) — against the recorded cursor trace, and reports:

- **CAMERA PLAN**: per shot — index, start, end, hold seconds, zoom, center, zone. This is the
  authoritative answer to "how long does each zoom last and where is it".
- **`cursor-offscreen`**: samples cursor-vs-crop at 10fps over the whole video; flags any span
  ≥0.2s where the cursor sits outside the visible crop (4px tolerance).
- **`zoom-too-long`**: a shot with zoom > 1.05 held > 12s.
- **`inactivity`**: > 5s with no cursor motion / typing / click in the *final* timeline (a capped
  4s tool spinner is fine — verify skips those automatically).
- **`zone-clipped`**: focus zone not fully inside its crop (should never fire — by construction).
- **`zoom-pump`**: a wide shot shorter than 2s sandwiched between two zooms, or a re-focus nearly
  identical to the previous shot — merge into ONE `focus()` on the union of both zones.
- **`record-alert`**: warnings raised during recording (a click outside the focused zone, or
  visible error text detected after a click — the latter always means re-record).

Exit code 1 when any alert exists. Alerts are ignorable *by explicit decision only* — the skill
requires each one fixed or justified in the delivery report.

## Frame inspection (`inspect.mjs`) — letting the agent "see" the video

`node scripts/inspect.mjs <renderDir> [--times 3,10.5] [--alerts]`

Extracts frames from **the raw capture** (pre-zoom, full 1920×1080) and draws on each: the crop
rect the final video shows at that instant (white, 4px), the active focus zone (gray, 2px), the
scripted cursor position (filled 16px square). `review/inspect.json` carries exact numbers per
frame: crop rect, cursor position, in/out-of-crop flag, cursor distance to each crop edge, zone
box. Default sampling = settle point + midpoint of every shot; `--alerts` samples at every
guardrail alert. Drawing on the raw frame (not the final) is deliberate: you can see both what the
viewer sees (inside the white box) *and* what sits just outside it — exactly what you need to
judge a bad crop.

## Capture (`screencast.mjs`) — why not Playwright `recordVideo`

Playwright's built-in recorder muxes a VFR WebM whose frame timestamps carry transport jitter —
that reads as a stuttering cursor and choppy loading animations. This engine captures compositor
frames itself via CDP `Page.startScreencast` (JPEG q82, `everyNthFrame: 1`), keeps each frame's
exact compositor timestamp, and assembles a clean CFR 30fps `raw.mp4` with ffmpeg's concat demuxer
(per-frame durations from the real timestamps). `startFilmRecording(page, renderDir, timeline)`
also re-anchors the timeline epoch at capture start, so **video time == timeline event time by
construction**.

Every record writes `capture-stats.json` — frame count, achieved fps, and frame-interval
p50/p90/max. Healthy: ~30fps, p90 ≤ 80ms. A long `max` is normal (static screens paint nothing; the
assembler holds the frame). Low fps *during motion* means the machine is starving the recorder.
Validate any `scripts/` change with `node scripts/test-engine.mjs`.

## Cursor trace

`actions.mjs`'s `filmMove()` logs an analytical eased path into `timeline.cursor` (~30
samples/sec) and animates the on-screen pointer via `requestAnimationFrame` inside the page
(compositor rate — typically 60 Hz). Playwright's mouse jumps to the destination once, after
the animation, so hover/click targets stay correct. `cursorAt()` in guardrails linearly
interpolates between samples. Never move the Playwright mouse directly in a beat script —
you'd bypass the trace and blind the guardrails.

## Film cursor (`film-cursor.mjs`)

SVG arrow pointer (lucide `mouse-pointer-2` path) at 1.6x scale by default (`cursor.scale` in
`demo.config.json`), thin white outline + drop shadow so it reads on both light and dark UI.

**rAF travel:** long moves run through `__filmCursorAnimate` at compositor refresh rate. Stepping
`page.mouse.move()` from Node instead would be ~30-80ms per CDP round-trip (~10-15 effective Hz,
choppy video). Press feedback still follows real input: `mousedown` squashes to ~0.8x, `mouseup`
springs back — one press per real click.

**Navigations:** a new document remounts the cursor at the default center. `prepareFilmPage()`
installs a `framenavigated` hook that re-syncs the pointer to the last known position
(`resyncFilmCursor`), so the cursor never visibly teleports after a reload or route change.

`filmMove()` is the only sanctioned way to travel. Clicks are a real `mouse.down` → 90ms →
`mouse.up` at the settled position (never `locator.click()`, which re-computes the point and
can visibly teleport the real mouse away from the drawn pointer).

`test-engine.mjs` is a full e2e smoke test on a synthetic page (no real app) — run it after any
change to `scripts/`.

## Resolution and zoom headroom

The recording (`FILM_VIEWPORT`, 1920x1080 by default) **is** the coordinate space `boundingBox()`
returns boxes in — the screencast captures the viewport 1:1, so no scale factor to track between
"where Playwright says the button is" and "where it is in the raw video." Zoom is capped at
`maxZoom: 1.7` by default because we're zooming into a 1920x1080 source without recording at a
higher physical resolution — a 2x+ zoom would visibly soften/pixelate. If a sharper deep-zoom is
needed later, record at a larger viewport (e.g. 2560x1440) and raise `maxZoom` — everything
downstream is resolution-agnostic (it computes in source pixels, not fixed constants).

## Styled frame (`render.mjs` → `applyStyledFrame`, presets in `presets.mjs`)

Single `filter_complex` graph, four layers, source video is `[0:v]`:

```
color=...:d=<clip+1>[bg]                                    # canvas background
color=black:...,format=yuva420p,colorchannelmixer=aa=0.55,
  boxblur=24:1[shadow]                                       # soft rect, alpha-blurred
[bg][shadow]overlay=...[bg2]                                 # shadow, offset down+right
[0:v]scale=contentW:contentH:flags=lanczos[content]
[bg2][content]overlay=x=padX:y=padY[bg3]                     # the actual window
[bg3]drawbox=...:color=<borderColor>:t=1[out]                # 1px border
```

**Perf trap already hit and fixed:** the `color=` lavfi sources need a duration (`d=`) — do **not**
default it to something large (e.g. `d=600`) "because `-shortest` will cut it anyway." `boxblur` runs
on every generated frame *before* `-shortest` truncates the output, so a 600s source blurs 18,000
frames to produce a 6s clip — this can hang ffmpeg for minutes. `compose.mjs` always passes the
real clip duration (`durationSec`, ffprobed) into `applyStyledFrame`; `render.mjs` throws if it's
missing specifically so this doesn't regress silently.

`format=yuva420p` is what gives the shadow a real alpha channel for `overlay` to blend — a plain
`color=black@0.6` string-alpha, chained through `boxblur`, isn't guaranteed to survive as blendable
alpha in every ffmpeg build. If the shadow ever renders as a hard black box instead of a soft one,
check that chain first; the escape hatch is `shadowOpacity: 0` (border-only, still reads as "framed").

Ship six presets out of the box (`presets.mjs`): `studio-dark` (near-black, subtle shadow),
`clean-light` (off-white, faint shadow), `none` (no background/shadow, border only),
`rounded-dark` (`studio-dark` with rounded corners, no wallpaper/title bar), and `macos-dark` /
`macos-light` (wallpaper background + rounded corners + macOS-style title bar with traffic-light
dots — see below). Add your own by editing `PRESETS` in `presets.mjs`, or pass
`background`/`borderColor`/`shadowOpacity`/… directly to `composeFilm()`.

### Chrome path (wallpaper / rounded corners / title bar)

`applyStyledFrame` takes a second code path (`chrome.mjs`) whenever `wallpaper`, `radius`, or
`titlebarHeight` is set — every other preset takes the plain path above, byte-identical to before
this feature existed. The chrome path pre-renders two (or three, with a wallpaper) PNGs once per
compose with `sharp`, then feeds them into the same single-pass ffmpeg graph as extra inputs:

```
.chrome-mask.png     contentW x contentH  — rounds the corners the content owns (via alphamerge)
.chrome-overlay.png  windowW x windowH    — title bar fill + traffic-light dots + outer border stroke
.chrome-bg.png       canvasW x canvasH    — wallpaper, cover-cropped, optional blur + dark dim layer
```

The title bar occupies the bottom `titlebarHeight` px of the existing top padding (`padY`) — it
does not shrink `contentW`/`contentH`, so `renderZoomed`'s output size is unaffected either way.
Corner ownership: the content mask rounds its bottom corners always, and its top corners only when
there's no title bar (otherwise the title bar owns the rounded top, content's top edge is square and
sits flush underneath it). `chrome.mjs`'s `roundedRectPath(w, h, {tl,tr,br,bl})` draws any
combination of square/rounded corners as one SVG path — used for both the mask and the title bar
fill so they always line up pixel-for-pixel.

Bundled wallpapers (`assets/wallpapers/*.png`) are synthetic mesh-gradient PNGs generated by
`generate-wallpaper.mjs` (SVG blurred radial blobs + a raw-pixel noise layer to avoid 8-bit gradient
banding) — no stock photos, so they're safe to redistribute in this MIT repo and need no network
fetch at render time. `resolveWallpaper()` in `presets.mjs` maps a bundled name to its file, or
passes through any other path as-is (bring your own wallpaper).

## Cross-platform notes

- CLI entry-point detection (`if (import.meta.url === ...)`) must use
  `pathToFileURL(process.argv[1]).href`, not string-concatenating `file://${process.argv[1]}` —
  `argv[1]` is backslash-separated on Windows, `import.meta.url` never is. Every script here that's
  meant to run standalone follows this pattern; copy it if you add another one.
- All ffmpeg calls go through `spawnSync('ffmpeg', args)` with an **args array**, never a shell
  string — the generated filter strings contain unescaped single quotes and commas that are only
  valid because ffmpeg's own filtergraph parser sees them, not the shell. See the
  `sync-narration` skill's `SKILL.md` for the same gotcha in the captioning pipeline.
- `spawnSync` calls carry generous timeouts so a runaway filter graph fails loudly instead of
  hanging a render indefinitely.
